## Today

::: incremental
-   Why talk to people?
-   Research-y ways of talking to people
-   Questionnaires
    -   Design
    -   Administration
    -   Analysis

## Why talk to people?

Ideas?

::: incremental
-   We cannot observe thoughts/emotions/attitudes
-   Behaviour can be observed but this may not be feasible
-   Sometimes they know best!
:::

## How to talk to people

::: incremental
-   Interview
    -   Qualitative (un-/semi-structured)
    -   Structured/poll
-   Focus groups
-   Questionnaires
:::

## Qualitative Interview

::: columns
::: column
::: center
:heart_eyes:
:::

::: incremental
-   In-depth exploration
-   Flexibility
-   Rapport
-   "Natural" conversational setting
-   Ability to rephrase/check understanding
:::
:::

::: column
::: center
:sob:
:::

::: incremental
-   Skill-dependent
-   Time-intensive and effortful
-   Doesn't scale-up
-   Trust can be an issue
-   Laborious analysis
:::
:::
:::

## Structured Interview

-   Essentially a questionnaire administered by an interviewer
-   Useful for certain populations (*e.g.*, children, those who cannot
    read, low return probability)
-   In research on general population, kinda the worst of both worlds

## Focus group

::: columns
::: column
::: center
:heart_eyes:
:::

::: incremental
-   Qual interview pros, but...
-   Wider spectrum of topics
-   More dynamic than 1-on-1 interview
-   More time-efficient
:::
:::

::: column
::: center
:sob:
:::

::: incremental
-   Group dynamic may be a problem
-   May be difficult to moderate/facilitate
-   People may be reluctant to express themselves in front of others
-   ... +qual interview cons
:::

## Questionnaire

::: columns
::: column
::: center
:heart_eyes:
:::

::: incremental
-   Standardised
-   Cheap and scalable
-   Easy to administer (online survey services)
-   Quantifiable data
-   Measurable properties (reliability, consistency)
-   Allow hypothesis testing
:::
:::

::: column
::: center
:sob:
:::

::: incremental
-   Difficult to develop and validate
-   No flexibility
-   Only basic comprehension checks
-   Items are open to interpretation
-   No rapport
-   Susceptible to "demand characteristics"

## Theory

::: incremental
-   What is the construct we're measuring?
    -   Attitude?
    -   Personality?
    -   Social integration?
    -   Socio-economic status...?
-   What is the theoretical framework for the construct?
-   Is the construct unitary or does it have components?
:::

## Example: Attitude

::: incremental
-   What do you *think*? (cognitive component)
-   How do you *feel*? (emotional component)
    -   Valence
    -   Strength
-   What do you *do*? (conative component)
:::

## Deriving items/questions

::: incremental
-   Qualitative research is a great resource!
-   Established literature/measures
-   Conceptual analysis
-   Expert opinion
-   As with most things, it's an **iterative process**
:::

## Wording

::: incremental
-   Focus should be on **clarity** and **simplicity**
-   Don't assume people will get what you mean
-   Use accessible language (no big words)
-   No double-barrelled questions
    -   "Do you like pi√±a colada and getting caught in the rain?"
-   Questions should not be leading
    -   "Are you the sort of person who enjoys such atrocities as
        strawberry ice cream?"
-   Avoid absolutes (always, never, *etc.*)
-   Negative phrasing can be confusing
:::

## Item types

::: incremental
-   Text input
-   Forced choice (yes/no)
-   Multiple choice
-   Rating scales
    -   Likert
    -   Semantic differential
    -   Frequency

## Demographic questions

::: incremental
-   Important to know "who" your participants were
-   Usually, at least gender and age are collected
-   If **relevant**, other characteristics can be collected
    -   Education level
    -   Ethnicity
    -   Sexual orientation
    -   Political preference...
-   Can be seen as invasive/de-anonymising
-   Don't collect information you don't need!
:::

## Considerations

::: incremental
-   When designing a questionnaire, it's good to think about how you'll
    analyse it
    -   *e.g.,* collecting age vs age category
-   Ask multiple (at the *very least* 3) good questions per
    component/facet
-   **Acquiescence bias**: use reverse-coded questions
-   **Demand characteristics**
    -   People tend to show themselves in good light
    -   Some answers may be more socially acceptable
    -   Some people will try to "see though" the questionnaire
:::

## Analysis

::: incremental
-   There's an entire discipline dedicated to psychological measurement,
    including designing, administering, validating, and analysing
    questionnaires: **psychometrics**
-   Not within the scope of our course, but..
    -   There are mathematical/statistical tools for analysing
        psychometric properties of questionnaires (CTT, IRT)
    -   The structure of the measured construct can be explored/tested
        using methods, *e.g.,* exploratory/confirmatory factor analysis
    -   How to score a questionnaire is a non-trivial question (but sum
        scores are often used :unamused:)
-   Questionnaires are **a lot of work**!
