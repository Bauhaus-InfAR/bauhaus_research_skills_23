## The Methods section

::: incremental
-   Typically, 2^nd^ "chapter" of an empirical paper (under the IMRaD
    framework)
-   Takes off where Intro left off
-   Leads into Results
-   Detailed account of what was done and how it was done
:::

## What is it for?

::: incremental
-   Science relies on scrutiny and replication
-   *"The devil is in the details"*
-   To be able to evaluate a study, we need to know what was done
-   To replicate it, we need to be able to **precisely** follow the
    protocol
:::

## Structure

::: incremental
-   Participants/Subjects/Sample/Data
-   Procedure
-   Materials/Apparatus
-   (statistical) Hypotheses
-   Models/Analysis
:::

## Subjects/Sample

::: incremental
-   Not for us :smile:
-   Animal research
-   Material science
-   Biology/Chemistry
-   ...
:::

## Participants

::: incremental
-   In case of human research
-   Number (*N*)
-   Gender and age composition
    -   Other relevant characteristics
-   Recruitment method
-   Attrition (drop-out)
:::

## Data

::: incremental
-   Provenance (where did you get the data from)
    -   Did you collect it?
    -   Did you use someone else's? (cite!)
-   Collection method
-   What *is* in the dataset
-   Details of cleaning/processing
    -   Did you remove any data points? If so, why?
    -   How did you get it "in shape" for analysis?
:::

## Procedure

::: incremental
-   Only when there is a procedure to describe
    -   Experiment, research with people/animals
-   Detailed account of the sequence of actions taken
-   Where did it all take place, under what relevant circumstances?
-   Reader must be able to understand/recreate what happened
:::

## Materials/Apparatus

::: incremental
-   Detailed description of any
    -   Devices
    -   Technical setup
    -   Tests, measures, questionnaires
-   For questionnaires
    -   Number of items
    -   Format/response type
    -   Psychometric properties (*e.g.*, reliability)
:::

## Hypotheses

::: incremental
-   Clearly stated *operational* hypotheses
-   For quant studies, stated *statistical* hypotheses
    -   Which parameter of the statistical model tests the given H
    -   More on this perhaps next term
-   What is it that you're actually asking about the world in the
    context of your data and methodology
:::

## Models/Analysis

::: incremental
-   Details about the analytical steps
-   How are you extracting the results from the data?
-   Exact specification of any computational/statistical/ML models
-   Qualitative coding and analysis strategy (number of raters, their
    characteristics, triangulation procedure)
:::

## ML Models

::: incremental
-   Model architecture
-   Hyperparameters (search strategy)
-   Training algorithm (optimiser, No of steps/epochs, batches)
-   Evaluation criteria (loss function)
:::

## Tips

::: incremental
-   Be clear and concise!
-   Maintain a logical/sequential order of reporting
-   Include all necessary detail
-   Ask yourself: **If I didn't know what I do about my study, could I
    understand/reproduce it based on the Methods section?**
-   Ask someone else to read and explain your methods to you
-   **Read papers** and examine how good papers report Methods
