## Research question

::: incremental
-   A question specifying the focus of a project/thesis/dissertation
-   Important step in the research process
-   Requires familiarity with the topic
-   Forces multiple levels of analysis (conceptual, feasibility,
    importance)
-   Should be **well-defined** and **precise**
    -   Can you come up with **at least two different** interesting
        answers that you could realistically get from your study?
-   Developing a clear research question can often be an **iterative**
    process
:::

## Criteria for a good research Q

-   **F**easible
-   **I**nteresting
-   **N**ovel
-   **E**thical
-   **R**elevant

:::

## Feasible

::: incremental
-   Is the **scope** manageable?
-   Do you have sufficient resources (time, money, people)?
-   Do you have access to enough participants/data/units of observation
-   Do you have the required expertise?
-   Are there adequate methods to assess the question available?
:::

## Interesting

::: incremental
-   Do **you** actually want to know the answer?
    -   Personal interest is good for motivation, frustration tolerance,
        attention to detail...
    -   You should be interested in **finding out** the answer, not
        **proving** a point
-   Is anyone else going to care?
    -   Not necessarily a criterion for worthwhile research
    -   Makes it easier to secure funding, get things published, avoid
        awkward questions at your defence
    -   If not, why not?
-   Is the answer to the question **non-trivial**?
:::

## Novel

::: incremental
-   Is the answer to the question likely to yield new knowledge?
    -   Fill a gap
    -   Confirmation of disputed findings
    -   Refutation of prior findings
-   Novel $\ne$ "sexy"
-   Shouldn't be fetishised -- **replication** is important too!
:::

## Ethical

::: incremental
-   Is the study aligned with principles of fairness, justice, and
    equality?
-   Is the participant sample fair?
-   Whose voice is being amplified? Who is being silenced?
-   Is there a risk of harm to participants/researchers?
-   Is participation actually voluntary (what is the power dynamic)?
:::

## Relevant

::: incremental
-   Does the answer to the question have any consequences for
    -   Scientific knowledge
    -   Practice
    -   Policy
    -   Future research
    -   Stakeholders, *e.g.*, communities
-   Does it pass the "so what?" test?
-   Important for project/Master's thesis: Is the question within the
    remit of your study programme?
    -   Does it involve **urban form and function**?
:::

## Where do research questions come from?

::: incremental
-   Identified gap in the literature
-   Unsettled academic debate
-   Critique of prior research
-   Observation
-   Current affairs
-   Personal intuition/hunch
-   Conversations over coffee/lunch/drink
:::

## Refining a question

-   Not all RQs are born fully formed
-   Refining them can be an iterative process

## Researcher vs politician mindset

Â 

::: {style="font-size: 1.5em"}
Aim to **find out** about the world, **not to "prove", demonstrate, or
confirm** what you think or know is or should be the case!
:::

## Any questions?

## Over to you!

-   Work in pairs
-   Remind each other of your chosen research area
-   Explain to your partner how it is connected to the urban form and
    function
-   Discuss the following questions with regards to your topic:
    -   What two interesting things could you learn about the world by
        exploring this topic?
    -   How could you empirically study this topic?
    -   Do you have a **specific** research question in mind?

## Homework

-   Formulate a good research question in line with the principles we
    talked about
-   Keep it small, keep it simple
-   Think about how you could actually go about empirically answering
    your question.
-   Submit your homework using this
    [form](https://forms.gle/3wfyP2aKpo2R7PqJ9) (link also on Moodle).
