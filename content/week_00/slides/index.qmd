## Ground rules

- Be kind and respectful
- Let's make everyone feel safe with respect to who they are
    - No racism :raised_fist::skin-tone-6: :raised_fist::skin-tone-4: :raised_fist::skin-tone-2:
    - No sexism :female_sign: :transgender_symbol: :male_sign:
    - LGBTQ+ inclusive environment :rainbow:
- It's OK to disagree but let's keep things friendly
