## Today

:::{.incremental}
- Discussion of your ideas (homework)
- How do you do literature search?
- My tips
- Reading a research paper
- Citing and referencing sources
:::

## Your research topic ideas

:::{.incremental}
:::{.non-incremental}

 **You**

- Tell us what topic you chose
- Say what interests you about/attracts you to this topic
:::

:::{.non-incremental}

**Others**

- Are you familiar with the topic?
- Do you have any thoughts?
- Do you know any research on that topic?
:::
:::

## Literature search

- Why review literature?
- What types of literature do you survey?
- Where/how do you start?
- What platforms do you use?
- Do you know any literature search strategies?

## Why review literature?

:::{.incremental}
- To familiarise yourself with the **current state of knowledge**
- To gain **expertise**
- To understand **what** kinds of research questions have been explored and **how** they have been explored
- To **identify gaps** in knowledge
- To not reinvent the wheel and _"stand on the shoulders of giants"_ - science is a **collaborative effort**
- To **communicate** your expertise to your audience
- To not fail your thesis defence :smirk:
:::

## Types of literature

- Handbooks/Textbooks
- Monographs (AKA "books", including theses and dissertations)
- Edited volumes (anthology)
- Academic paper: research, review (systematic, meta-analysis), book review
- Professional literature _e.g.,_ Trade journals (Arch+, scape, urban design, DETAIL, â€¦)
- Newspaper articles, blogs, tweets
- Grey literature (reports from Gov and NGOs, white papers, _etc._)


## Where to look

:::{.incremental}
- University library [catalogue and discovery service](https://www.uni-weimar.de/en/university/structure/central-university-facilities/university-library/)
  - For more details about using university services both on and off-campus (and much more!) see [this valuable presentation](/docs/database_searching.pdf)
- Academic database services such as [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/)
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) ([tips on how to use it](https://paperpile.com/g/google-scholar-guide/))
- Machine-learning-powered tools, such as [Elicit](https://elicit.com/)
  - Beware of ChatGPT - it makes stuff up!
- [Some say](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/02/25/sci-hub-how-does-it-work/) that there's a way of accessing academic papers for free
  - No respect for the rights and financial interests of the publishers
  - Doing that is bad and you should not do it and please don't and oh dear why am I even telling you about it
:::

## Search strategy

:::{.incremental}
- Start with a review paper, encyclopedia entry, monograph, or even a wikipedia article
- Check the sources cited and find the relevant-sounding ones
- Google Scholar helps you with forward (works that cited the one you're looking at) and backward search (works cited by the one you're looking at)
- Always perform a keyword search to find relevant sources
- Look for papers with a large number of citations
  - Not necessarily good or true
  - Definitely influential so good to know about them!
- **Be selective** about what you read; don't get lost in aimless deep dives
- Useful [literature review guide](https://libguides.tcd.ie/literature-reviews/getting-started) and a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6148622/) on search strategy
:::

## Reading papers

:::{.incremental}
- Check abstract to see if the paper is relevant
  - **Don't take it at face value**, always read the paper!
- **Critically examine** the argument laid out in the Introduction
  - What is being argued?
  - Does it make sense?
- Are the measures/methodology described in the Methods section **appropriate for the goal**?
- Do the results **check out**
  - For quantitative papers, expertise in statistics may be needed
- Are the conclusions in Discussion section **justified by the results**?
- **Save, summarise, annotate!** Otherwise you'll forget
:::

## Citing sources

- Why do we cite sources?

:::{.incremental}
- To **support** arguments with **evidence**
- To **give credit** to other people's work
- To show you've done your research
- Using others' ideas without citation is **plagiarism** (big no-no!)
:::

:::{.incremental}
- Cite every time you make an empirical claim that is not common knowledge
:::

## Cite or not?

:::{.incremental}
- "There is an ongoing debate in the scientific community about the definition of an urban area"
  - **cite**
- "There exists a large body of literature on the topic of the relationship between the configuration of public spaces and social pathology"
  - **cite multiple sources**
- "The derivative shows the sensitivity of change of a function's output with respect to the input." 
  - **don't cite**
- "The aforementioned study suffers from the following shortcomings"
  - **depends!**
  - Are you the one pointing them out or are you using someone else's analysis?
:::

## Paraphrasing vs quoting

:::{.incremental}
- As a general rule, paraphrasing > direct quotes
- Avoid direct quotes
  - Only if the phrasing in the cited work is important
  - If you're critiquing a particular argument and the wording is relevant
- When paraphrasing, make sure you are **not misinterpreting** the author
:::

## How to cite/reference

:::{.incremental}
- There are referencing style guides
  - [American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples) (seems like this is the preferred one at Bauhaus)
  - [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/cmos_formatting_and_style_guide/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html)
  - [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/IEEE-Reference-Guide.pdf)
  - [Modern Language Association](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_general_format.html)
- Whatever style you choose, **be consistent**
- **All** cited sources must be in the list of references
- **Only** cited sources must be in the list of references
- Use **referencing software**, such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), or [EndNote](https://endnote.com/?language=en)
  - Really though, you can't imagine how much it'll help you!
