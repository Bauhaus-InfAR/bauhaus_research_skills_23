## Today

:::{.incremental}
- What do we mean by "Science"
- How do we find out about the world?
- Facts & Logic&trade;
- Falsification
- Hypothesis, theory, research programme, paradigm
- A little sociology of science
- We'll be simplifying out of necessity
- Objective is for you to start thinking about the questions we'll raise, not for me to tell you what to think

## What springs to mind when you hear "science"?

## Knowing about the world

<br><br>What's the difference between science and other modes of knowing?<br><br>

- Science is **empirical**
- It is **systematic**
- It is **objective** and based on **facts** and **logic**[???]{.fragment}
:::

## Common-sense view of Science

> Science is **objective** knowledge based on **facts** and **logic**
<!-- > [dude]{.author} -->

\ 

:::{.incremental}
Challenges:

- What are facts and where do they come from?
- How do we derive knowledge from these facts?
- What does it mean for something to be objective?
:::

## Facts

- Statments about the world
- According to the common-sense view they are
    - directly accessible to observation by senses
    - independent of theory
    - objective

## Senses

Do senses provide an unmediated representation of reality?

## Objective

:::{.incremental}
If point of view and assumptions/theory are **inherent** to observation, then what does _objective_ even mean?

- **Publicly** and **independently** verifiable methods
- Recognising theoretical **assumptions**
- Theory/data that are **open to revision** and **improvement**
- Free from **avoidable** forms of bias (confounds, cherry-picking data, experimenter bias)
:::


## Deriving knowledge

How do we derive understanding of the world from facts?

:::{.incremental}
- Common-sense view says "using logic"
- Let's talk about logic then, in particular
    - Deduction
    - Induction
:::

## Deduction

:::{.incremental .columns .logic .tight}
:::{.column width="fit-content"}
1. **All** examples of deduction are cringe
1. This is an example of deduction
1. (Therefore) this is cringe
:::

:::{.non-incremental .column width="fit-content"}
1. **Some** examples of deduction are cringe
1. This is an example of deduction
1. (Therefore) this is cringe**?**
:::
:::

\ 

:::{.incremental}
- From universal to specific
- Preserves truth
- Conclusion logically follows from premises
- Does **not** generate new knowledge
:::

## Induction

:::{.incremental .logic  .tight}
1. First example of logical inference was cringe
1. Second example of logical inference was cringe
1. This example of logical inference is cringe
1. (Therefore) all examples of logical inference are cringe
:::

\ 

:::{.incremental}
- From specific to universal
- Generates new knowledge
- Does **not** preserve truth
- Conclusion does **not necessarily** follow from premises 
:::

## Knowledge verification

- Verifying/proving things based on empirical evidence is inherently inductive
- Induction is non-truth-preserving
- So how can we ever verify anything empirically?

:::{.incremental}
:::{.center style="font-size:2em;margin-bottom:1em"}
**We cannot!**
:::

So... What's the alternative?
:::

## Falsification

- We cannot conclusively prove that a general rule is true
- We can, however, prove that a general rule is **not** true

\ 

:::{.incremental .non-incremental}
The universal statement...

:::{.center style="padding-block:1em;font-size:1.5em;"}
_"All male architects only wear black"_
:::

...can be **falsified** by finding even one male architect who doesn't only wear black
:::

## Developing theory, testing hypotheses

:::{.incremental}
- We can use inductive reasoning to develop **theories**
- Theories enable us to deduce **hypotheses**
    - If a theory is to be regarded as scientific, it must be able to yield **falsifiable** hypotheses
- Hypothese can then be systematically tested by attempting to falsify them
- Failure to falsify a meaningful non-trivial hypothesis strengthens a theory
- Falsifying a hypothesis that is a direct prediction of a theory necessitates a rejection/modification of the theory
:::

## Theory & hypothesis

### Theory

- In colloquial sense: a hunch, a guess
- Conceptual framework that **describes**, **explains**, and **predicts** observations

### Hypothesis

- A statement about a single relationship between things
- Must be testable/falsifiable
- Can be based on theory but also on intuition

## Predictive power of Theory - Biology

- According to the modern theory of evolution, all living species share common ancestry
- Humans and other great apes share a relatively recent ancestor
- Humans have 23 chromosome pairs
- Other great apes (chimps, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans) have 24 chromosome pairs

## Predictive power of Theory - Biology

:::{.incremental}
- Classical mechanics is a theory that describes the motion of macroscopic objects, including stars and planets
- It can be used to predict the position of a given planet in a solar system at a given time point
- Observations of Uranus made in 1^st^ half of 19^th^ century didn't match the prediction
- A possible explanation: There is another large body behind Uranus that exerts gravitational influence
    - The theory allowed for calculating of its position
    - Observations revealed...

## Predictive power of Theory - Linguistic {background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Ecoregion_PA0814.svg/1280px-Ecoregion_PA0814.svg.png" filter="brightness(.2) opacity(.8)" source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontic%E2%80%93Caspian_steppe#/media/File:Ecoregion_PA0814.svg"}

:::{.incremental}
- Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is a reconstructed language spoken around 4500-2500\ BCE probably in the area of the [Pontic-Caspian Steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontic%E2%80%93Caspian_steppe)
- Ancestor of all Indo-European languages (_e.g.,_ Albanian, Gaelic, Hindi, Italian, Farsi, Latvian, Punjabi, Romani, Swedish)
- There are rules about how speech sounds change in different language families and languages
- **Some** vowels don't seem to follow these rules
:::

## Predictive power of Theory - Linguistic

:::{.columns .tight}

- Sanskrit: _bʰr**ā́**tṛ_
- Punjabi: _Bhar**ā**_
- Latin: _fr**ā**ter_
- Old Prussian: _br**a**ti_

- Czech: _br**a**tr_
- German: _Br**u**der_
- Welsh: _br**aw**d_
- Farsi: _ber**â**dar_
:::
:::

:::{.incremental}
- These occurrences **could** be explained systematically if PIE had certain consonants that didn't survive in any of the living child languages
- Currently, at least three such consonants are hypothesised (h~1~, h~2~, h~3~)

## Predictive power of Theory - Linguistic

:::{.incremental}
- Hittite is an ancient language spoken in Anatolia around 1700-1200\ BCE 
- Deciphered in early 20^th^ century and discovered to be Indo-European
- It **still had two of these hypothesised PIE consonants**, unlike other known I-E languages, which have none

| \***h₂**ent | ante | ánti | antí | **ḫ**anti |
:::

## Dominant system

:::{.tight}
- Not all theories/hypotheses are treated equally in scientific practice
- A single failure of a prediction doesn't lead to rejection of a large theoretical model
- **Paradigm** -- dominant set of theories, methods, and standards -- can develop
- Paradigm provides a model of
    - What kind of questions to explore
    - What things to observe
    - How to interpret findings...
- During the rule of a paradigm, it's business as usual until a critical mass of contradictions builds up, leading to **paradigm shift**
- New theoretical model is established, replacing (and absorbing) the previous one
:::

## Paradigm shift

## So much more...

- There is **much** more to talk about
    - More nuanced philosophy of science
    - [Non-western scientific traditions](https://hssonline.org/page/teaching_nonwestern)
    - [Feminist perspectives on science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-science/)
    - Structural and systemic issues with academia
    - Historical issues whose effects we can still feel
- I encourage you to explore these
- Despite these I think science is cool and I hope now you agree
