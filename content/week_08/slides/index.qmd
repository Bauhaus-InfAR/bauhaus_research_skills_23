Discussion

## Introduction

:::{.incremental}
- Introduces the reader to the problem at hand
- Explains why the research is relevant
- Points at a knowledge gap
- Reviews and **analyses** literature
- States the research question (and conceptual hypothesis)
- Links the study with the analysis of the topic with clear line of argumentation
:::

## Establish a niche

:::{.incremental}
- Start with an observation that gets the reader interested
- Define the problem and necessary terms
- Explain why the topic is worthy of exploration
- Provide brief summary of the general state of knowledge
- Point at a problem
- Identify a gap/disagreement/insufficiency in literature
:::

## Literature review

:::{.incremental}
- Introduces important concepts and findings to the reader
- Structures your argument and anchors it to existing research
- Demonstrates that you've "done your homework"
- Review most relevant/important literature for each concept you're dealing with
- Don't just summarise; analyse/critically examine
:::

## Link to present study

:::{.incremental}
- Line of argument presented in Intro connects the problem with your study
- By the end of Intro, the reader should understand
  - What is the problem at hand
  - What is the aim of the study
  - Why study the problem in this way
  - What is the specific research question (explicitly stated)
  - What (if any) hypotheses are you testing
:::

## Hypothesis

- Statement about something in the world that
- Either true or false
- Not yet been shown to be true or false
- Often stated in terms of differences or relationships between things/people/groups

## What makes a good hypothesis?

:::{.incremental}

- **Testability** - it must be possible for the data to either support or disconfirm a hypothesis
- **Specificity** - it must be clear what exactly is being claimed and what the expectation is
- Brief and clearly formulated, and about a single thing

- **Good hypothesis:** _"The recent observed rising trend in global temperatures on Earth is primarily driven by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions."_

- **Bad hypothesis:** _"Hom&oelig;opathic products can cure people, but sometimes they make them worse before they make them better, and the effect is only apparent subjectively with respect to some vague 'holistic' notions rather than a specific well-defined and testable set of criteria."_
:::


## Levels of hypothesis

:::{.incremental}

- **Conceptual**: Expressed in normal language on the level of concepts/constructs
- **Operational**: Restates a conceptual hypothesis in terms of how constructs are measured in a given study
- **Statistical**: Translates an operational hypothesis into language of mathematics
:::

## Conceptualisation

:::{.incremental}
- Let's say we're interested in factors predicting [sport climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing) performance
- **Research question:** Are there morphological characteristics that predispose some people to be better at climbing?
- We have a hunch that having relatively long arms might be beneficial

\ 

- **Conceptual hypothesis:** Climbers have relatively longer arms than non-climbers
:::

## Operationalisation

:::{.incremental}
- Process of defining variables in terms of how they are measured
  - The *concept* of street business can be operationalised as the average number of pedestrians who enter the street in an one-hour window measured on 5 different occasions
  - The *concept* of access to food/beverage service can be operationalised as...?

- There are often multiple ways of operationalising the same construct
- It is crucial for the operationalisation to be **valid**
:::

## Example: The Ape Index

- The [ape index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape_index) (AI) compares a person's arm span to their height
  - Positive AI means, that your arm span is larger then your height
  - 165 cm (5&#x2032;5&#x2033;) tall person with an arm span of 167 cm has an ape index of +2  
  - Found to correlate with performance in some sports (_e.g._, climbing, swimming, basketball)

## Example: The Ape Index

## Operational hypotheses

- **Conceptual hypothesis:** Climbers have relatively longer arms than non-climbers

\ 

- **Operational hypothesis:** Elite climbers have, on average, a higher ape index than general population

## Formalisation

:::{.incremental}
- Translation of an operational hypothesis to the language of maths
- Deals with specific values (or ranges of values) of population parameters
  - Mean of a given population can be hypothesised do be of a given value
  - We can hypothesise a difference in means between two populations
- Yields a **statistical hypothesis**
:::

## Statistical hypothesis

- **Conceptual hypothesis:** Climbers have relatively longer arms than non-climbers

\ 

- **Operational hypothesis:** Elite climbers have, on average, a higher ape index than general population

\ 

- **Statistical hypothesis:** $\mu_{\text{AI}\_climb} \gt \mu_{\text{AI}\_gen}$

## Writing tips

:::{.incremental}
- Write for an intelligent but **lay** reader
- Write in a **clear and concise** manner
- Write **simple**, don't obfuscate with complicated language and sentence structure
  - Writing should be only ever as complicated as the topic necessitates
- Use words in their standard meaning
- If using terms of art, define them
- Avoid clich√© and banal statements
- **Always** cite sources (otherwise it's plagiarism)
