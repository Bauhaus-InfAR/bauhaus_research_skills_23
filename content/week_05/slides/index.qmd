## Today

:::{.incremental}
- Approaches to research
- Quantitative and qualitative approaches
- Simulation
- Main focus: **Qualitative research**
:::

## Regarding your project

- You are _welcome_ to pick a topic you wish to pursue in your Master's thesis
- You are **not required** to do so!

## Research approach

:::{.incremental}
- Not particularly well-defined term
- Informed by epistemological views and the problem at hand
- Informs study design and analysis
- A single problem can often be addressed using multiple approaches
:::

## Quantitative & qualitative

## Computer simulation/modelling

:::{.incremental}
- Data are **generated** (vs collected) based on specified parameters
- Allows evaluating outcomes based on a given set of constraints
- Useful for comparing competing designs, assessing effects of a change, _etc_.
- Traffic/pedestrian flow
- Parametrised street/parcel generation
- Urban space use
- Physical properties of urban design (irradiance, air flow...)
:::


## Computer simulation/modelling

:::{.incremental}
- Models (computer, statistical) are _abstractions_ and are _always based on theoretical assumptions_
- Results are only ever as good as the models are realistic

## Qualitative research

A strategy for systematic collection, organisation, and interpretation of textual information

:::{.incremental}
- Deliberate
- Considering broader context, strengths & limitations
- Informed by goals
- Relies on established, well-defined methodology
- "Textual" includes video, audio, transcripts, media...
:::

## Motivation

:::{.incremental}
- Social sciences study people and human* **interaction, societies, institutions**...
- These are all **imbued with meaning**
- The object of inquiry is not inanimate but is an **agent embedded in context**
:::

## Disclaimer

- Extremely broad collection of methodological approaches
- Each has its own philosophical underpinnings (_e.g._: phenomenology, constructivism, symbolic interactionism...)
- It's not possible to cover any, let alone all of them exhaustively here

## Characteristics

:::{.incremental}
- Does **not** aim to test hypotheses
- Can be used to **generate** hypotheses
- Its goal is to understand a **specific phenomenon** in terms of **meaning**
- Focuses on **depth** vs breadth of understanding
- Situated in **natural** setting (vs experiment/lab study)
- Uses **purposeful** vs random sampling
- Analyses data via **iterative interpretation**
:::

## Outcomes

:::{.incremental}
- Recurrent themes
  - Patterns of behaviour
  - Group interactions
  - Individual perceptions/experiences
- Hypotheses
- Questionnaires/survey instruments
- Taxonomies
- Conceptual models
:::

## Selected methodologies

- Verbal protocol analysis
- Enthnography
- Phenomenology
- Grounded theory

## Verbal protocol analysis

:::{.incremental}
- AKA _"thinking aloud protocols"_
- Collecting data on cognitive processes
- Typical setup
  - Participants are given a task
  - Asked to verbalise their plan of solving the task
  - Recorded data are coded and analysed
:::

## Verbal protocol analysis

Segment |	Content |	Plan level |	Plan type
--------|--------------------------|------------|-------------
1 |	OK… the first thing I would do is to make a list of the shops that are quite close to each other |	Executive |	Generate plan
2 |	and highlight the dance class remembering that it is at a specific time |	Metaplan |	Satisfy time constraints
3 |	I would try to get to it first and get it over with… |	Executive |	Order messages
4 |	probably, in reality I would drop it…. |	Executive |	Evaluate plan Eliminate 

## Ethnography

:::{.incremental}
- Aims to capture social meaning and ordinary activities
- Researcher enters **natural setting**
- Involves spending an extended time in the setting, building rapport
- Interviews, observation, self-observation
- Focuses on
  - What is normal
  - What is available
  - What people say
  - What people do
  - How people work
:::

## Phenomenology

:::{.incremental}
- Aims to understand subjective experience from the participant's point of view
- Emphasis on reflecting of researcher's own assumptions, experience, preconceptions
- Involves **bracketing** off researcher's own phenomenology to achieve an understanding of the participant's point of view and to authentically describe it
- "What is it like to be you"
:::

## Grounded theory

:::{.incremental}
- Aim is to generate theory (conceptual framework)
- The theory is _grounded_ in the data and doesn't originate from assumptions
- Data collection and analysis occurs simultaneously
- Categorisations and codes develop from data, pre-existing conceptualisations are not used
- Uses **theoretical sampling** - more data is collected based on the identified needs for further theoretical development
- "Go where the data takes you"
:::

## Issues in qualitative research

:::{.incremental}
- Researcher is the instrument
- Need to reflect on one's **values, assumptions, biases, attitudes** and how they might impact the study
- Elements of methodology (_e.g._, codes) may change during the course of research
:::

## Criteria of good qualitative research:

:::{.incremental}
- **Credibility**
  - Can the data support the claims?
  - Can be established through prolonged engagement, through discussions with other researchers/participants, and through critical self-reflection.

- **Transferability**
  - Can the findings be transferred to similar contexts?
  - Requires extensive, detailed, and careful descriptions of the research context

- **Dependability**
  - Ensuring that researchers maintain a record of changes in the research process or research instrument (including themselves) over time

- **Confirmability**
  - Ensuring that the data used to support the conclusions are verifiable
:::

## Be advised

:::{.incremental}
- Qualitative research is very laborious
- It's not "the easy way out" vs quantitative research
- If should be chosen on its own merits if it's the right choice for the research question at hand, not because one is scared of maths
