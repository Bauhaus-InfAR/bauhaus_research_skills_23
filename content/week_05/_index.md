title: Quality time
---

This week we are talking about various approaches to research, contrasting qualitative and quantitative approaches. After an honourable mention of the use of simulation and computer modelling, we will focus on discussing how to investigate phenomena that cannot easily be measured.

Qualitative research methodology is a vast topic and we cannot do it justice in one lecture. For those interested in developing a deeper understanding, I recommend the University of Amsterdam course on the subject. Here, you can find the youtube playlist of the [first week of the module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9EtzjhJNA0&list=PLyLpEs0x9BnlSknrmahoMrr7V1563CGX9). Other weeks can be found on the [same channel](https://www.youtube.com/@researchmethodsandstatisti2134/playlists).
