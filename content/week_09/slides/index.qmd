## Measurement

:::{.incremental}
- Not just gauging dimensions such as height, distance, weight, or time

- Measurement is the _recording_ of any **quantifiable characteristic, behaviour, or attitude**

- The object of measurement can be pretty much anything:
  - participants
  - urban environment
  - aspects of a study
:::

## Measurement

- From the examples from previous lectures:
  - participants' birth year, generation, liking of avocado toast
  - use of cannabis and other recreational drugs
  - presence or absence of dyslexia
  - number of yearly deaths by drowning in a swimming pool
  - number of films starring Nicolas Cage per year
  - reaction time and accuracy on the Stroop task
  - between-subjects condition each participant was allocated to (congruent vs incongruent)
  - trial number
  - stimulus word and colour
  - within-subject condition: control vs experimental trial
:::


## Levels of measurement

:::{.incremental}
- Level of measurement refers to the kind of information we are working with when measuring attributes of interest

- There are four levels:

  - Nominal/categorical
  
  - Ordinal
  
  - Interval
  
  - Ratio
:::

## Nominal/categorical

:::{.incremental}
- Simply names or labels

- The only information at this level of measurement is group membership: which of the several possible categories the given observation belongs to

- Examples:
  - eye colour (*e.g.,* green, brown, blue)
  - condition (*e.g.,* congruent, incongruent, control)
  - stimulus word (*e.g.,* TEA, STATS, PURPLE)
  - rural vs urban area
:::

## Nominal/categorical

:::{.incremental}

- This level of measurement can be considered qualitative

- There are no quantifiable comparisons between the individual categories

  - It makes no sense to say that green is more than blue when it comes to eye colour
:::

## Ordinal

:::{.incremental}
- Le Tour de France 2023 was won by the Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard: he finished _first_

- The Slovenian rider Tadej Poga&ccaron;ar came _second_, with the Brit Adam Yates, taking the _third_ place

- It's possible to take all competitors and sort them _in order_
:::

## Ordinal

:::{.incremental}
- At the **ordinal** level, individual observations of the measured attribute can be ordered in a meaningful way

- However, it doesn't provide any information about the differences between individual points
  - We don't know _how much faster_ the winner was compared to the runner-up
  - The distance between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> doesn't have to be the same as the distance between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>, or between any adjacent pair of riders
  - Town, small city, medium city, big city, metropole
:::


## Likert scale

:::{.incremental}
- A classic ordinal-level measure to gauge people's opinions/attitudes is the Likert scale used in questionnaires:

  > 1. Strongly disagree
  > 2. Disagree
  > 3. Neither agree nor disagree
  > 4. Agree
  > 5. Strongly agree

- We can't say that the difference in agreement between "Agree" and "Neither agree nor disagree" is the same as the difference between "Disagree" and "Strongly disagree"
:::


## Interval

:::{.incremental}
- At the interval level of measurement, the **differences between pairs of adjacent values** are the same

- The difference in temperature between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius is the same as that between 35째C and 36째C

- The **intervals** marked by the degrees are evenly spaced or _equidistant_

- There is not an **absolute zero point** so we cannot say that 40째C is _twice as hot_ as 20째C.

- In psychology, a good example is IQ
  - Someone with an IQ of 200 is _not twice as smart_ as someone with an IQ of 100
  - There is no such thing as an IQ of zero.
:::

## Ratio

:::{.incremental}
- At the ratio level, there is a meaningful zero point
  
  - A person who is 36 years old _is three times as old_ as a person who is 12

<br>

- Examples of the ratio level of measurement in psychology

  - Population of an area

  - Distance between given points

  - Score on an exam

  - Income
:::


## Levels of measurement

- **Measurement level is NOT an inherent characteristic of the measured attribute; it is the characteristic of the _measurement_**

\ 

:::{.incremental}
- It is possible to measure a single thing at different levels
  
  - Age can be on the **interval** level: years, months, weeks, days...

  - In the avocado toast example, age was measured as membership in one a generation
  
  - This can be seen as either a categorical or ordinal measurement
:::

## Variables

:::{.incremental}
- The point of measuring characteristics or attributes is to assess the value (*e.g.*, amount, number) of the given characteristic for each subject of interest (participant, city...)

  - This is a trivial statement: if we knew someone's height, we wouldn't need to measure it
  
- Why do we not know the value of the attribute for every subject?

  - Because the value changes from case to case; it **varies**!

- **A variable is a characteristic whose value varies within a set of subjects of interest**
:::

## Variables

:::{.incremental}
- Pretty much anything can be a variable

  - Amount of greenery/traffic

  - Accessibility/centrality of a location

  - Type of land use
  
  - People's attitude towards cycling

  - Time point of measurement in a longitudinal study
::: 


## Variables

:::{.incremental}
- Whether or not something is a variable is _independent of whether or not it is being measured!_

- Even things that are not measured can be variables

  - These are *unobserved* or *external* variables
  
  - They need to be carefully considered when designing a study and interpreting findings
:::

## Variable roles

:::{.incremental}
- In a study a variable can be a **predictor variables** or an **outcome variables**

- Predictor variables are variables used to model or _predict_ outcome variables
  - Cannabis use was the predictor variable in the gateway drug example
  - Use of other illegal recreational drugs was the outcome
  - In the avocado toast example, the generation to which a participant belonged was the predictor
  - Liking of avocado toast was the outcome
:::

## Variable roles

:::{.incremental}
- In _experimental_ design predictors are manipulated and the outcome is assumed to change as a result
 - Predictor is _independent_ of the outcome: It's an **independent variable (IV)**
 - Outcome is _dependent_ on the predictor: It's a **dependent variable (DV)**
 - The terms IV and DV are only used in experimental context
:::


## Variable roles

:::{.incremental}
- _Predictor_ and _outcome_ are roles we assign to variables based on theory

- A variable that is the predictor in one theoretical model can be the outcome in another

- If a theoretical framework is missing, it may not even be clear which variable fulfils which "role"

  - In the example of swimming pool drownings and Nicolas Case films, it's not clear which is which
:::

## Variables of everyday

:::{.incremental}
- We often talk about variables in the context of maths, stats, and research
- However, thinking about varying characteristics is just a way of systematising the world around us
- We can apply it to most things, even books on your shelf:

## Variables of everyday

- These books can be assessed on many characteristics (variables):

## Variables

:::{.incremental}
- Some variables _vary_ a lot (they contain many different _values_)
  - Author's surname or year of publication
  
- Others only change over a small number of values
  - Rating or whether or not I read the book in its original language

- Variables can **always be represented as number**
  - *Superb* rating can be assigned the value 9, while a _Terrible_ rating the value 1
  - The more I like the book, the higher the number it gets
  - Even **categorical** variables can be assigned _arbitrary_ numeric values
:::


## Missing data

:::{.incremental}
- Sometimes not all information can be recorded; There can be **missing data**

- In the [table](#53), there is no entry for "Rating" for for Jerzy Kosi&nacute;ski's novel _The Painted Bird_
  - I haven't read it! ('cause it's in Polish)

- Missing data are often assigned the value _NA_, for "**N**ot **A**pplicable"

- The presence of missing data and the patterns in them can sometimes provide valuable information so it's important to be aware of them and explore them
:::


## Missing data

:::{.incremental}

- Missing values are not uncommon and can result from different causes
  - An answer doesn't get registered
  - Participants skip a question or a task by accident
  - Recording error
  - Participants don't wish to disclose a piece of information
  - The information is not available
  - The variable itself does not apply to the particular context

:::


## Variable types

:::{.incremental}
- Variables come in different types based on the **values they can contain**.

- **Continuous variables** can contain **any numerical value** within a certain range
  - *E.g.*, time allows for arbitrary precision: month, day, hour, minute, second...

- **Discrete variables** can only contain **some values**
  - *E.g.*, number of pages: always an _integer_ (whole number)
  - There's no such thing as a book with 52.74 pages

- **Binary variables** can only take one of two possible values
  - A special case of discrete variables
  - The "Read in original" column can only contain the values "Yes" and "No"; there is no other option
  - Heads vs tails, pass/fail...
:::


## Variable types vs levels of measurement

:::{.incremental}
- Variables are _independent of whether or not we observe/measure them_ and so the **type of variable is inherent to the characteristic** and not to the measurement

- Observing of a variable involves measurement
- Variables have to be measured on one of the **levels of measurement**
:::


## Variable types vs levels of measurement

:::{.incremental}
- Book title variable has been measured on the _nominal (or categorical)_ level
- Publication year is measured on the _interval_ level
  - Hypothetically, we _could_ measure when a book came out by measuring time since the big bang, in which case it would be measured on the _ratio_ level
  - *The underlying variable* is continuous
- Like or dislike of a book is probably also continuous but was measured on a 9-point _ordinal_ scale

- As a shorthand it's common to say, for example, _"ordinal variable"_, when one means "variable measured on the ordinal level of measurement"
