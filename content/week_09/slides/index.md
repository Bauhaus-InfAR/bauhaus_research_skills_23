## Measurement

::: incremental
-   Not just gauging dimensions such as height, distance, weight, or
    time

-   Measurement is the *recording* of any **quantifiable characteristic,
    behaviour, or attitude**

-   The object of measurement can be pretty much anything:

    -   participants
    -   urban environment
    -   aspects of a study
:::

## Measurement

-   From the examples from previous lectures:
    -   participants' birth year, generation, liking of avocado toast
    -   use of cannabis and other recreational drugs
    -   presence or absence of dyslexia
    -   number of yearly deaths by drowning in a swimming pool
    -   number of films starring Nicolas Cage per year
    -   reaction time and accuracy on the Stroop task
    -   between-subjects condition each participant was allocated to
        (congruent vs incongruent)
    -   trial number
    -   stimulus word and colour
    -   within-subject condition: control vs experimental trial :::

## Levels of measurement

::: incremental
-   Level of measurement refers to the kind of information we are
    working with when measuring attributes of interest

-   There are four levels:

    -   Nominal/categorical

    -   Ordinal

    -   Interval

    -   Ratio
:::

## Nominal/categorical

::: incremental
-   Simply names or labels

-   The only information at this level of measurement is group
    membership: which of the several possible categories the given
    observation belongs to

-   Examples:

    -   eye colour (*e.g.,* green, brown, blue)
    -   condition (*e.g.,* congruent, incongruent, control)
    -   stimulus word (*e.g.,* TEA, STATS, PURPLE)
    -   rural vs urban area
:::

## Nominal/categorical

::: incremental
-   This level of measurement can be considered qualitative

-   There are no quantifiable comparisons between the individual
    categories

    -   It makes no sense to say that green is more than blue when it
        comes to eye colour
:::

## Ordinal

::: incremental
-   Le Tour de France 2023 was won by the Danish cyclist Jonas
    Vingegaard: he finished *first*

-   The Slovenian rider Tadej Pogačar came *second*, with the Brit Adam
    Yates, taking the *third* place

-   It's possible to take all competitors and sort them *in order*
:::

## Ordinal

::: incremental
-   At the **ordinal** level, individual observations of the measured
    attribute can be ordered in a meaningful way

-   However, it doesn't provide any information about the differences
    between individual points

    -   We don't know *how much faster* the winner was compared to the
        runner-up
    -   The distance between the 1`<sup>`{=html}st`</sup>`{=html} and
        2`<sup>`{=html}nd`</sup>`{=html} doesn't have to be the same as
        the distance between the 2`<sup>`{=html}nd`</sup>`{=html} and
        3`<sup>`{=html}rd`</sup>`{=html}, or between any adjacent pair
        of riders
    -   Town, small city, medium city, big city, metropole
:::

## Likert scale

::: incremental
-   A classic ordinal-level measure to gauge people's opinions/attitudes
    is the Likert scale used in questionnaires:

    > 1.  Strongly disagree
    > 2.  Disagree
    > 3.  Neither agree nor disagree
    > 4.  Agree
    > 5.  Strongly agree

-   We can't say that the difference in agreement between "Agree" and
    "Neither agree nor disagree" is the same as the difference between
    "Disagree" and "Strongly disagree"
:::

## Interval

::: incremental
-   At the interval level of measurement, the **differences between
    pairs of adjacent values** are the same

-   The difference in temperature between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius is
    the same as that between 35°C and 36°C

-   The **intervals** marked by the degrees are evenly spaced or
    *equidistant*

-   There is not an **absolute zero point** so we cannot say that 40°C
    is *twice as hot* as 20°C.

-   In psychology, a good example is IQ

    -   Someone with an IQ of 200 is *not twice as smart* as someone
        with an IQ of 100
    -   There is no such thing as an IQ of zero.
:::

## Ratio

::: incremental
-   At the ratio level, there is a meaningful zero point

    -   A person who is 36 years old *is three times as old* as a person
        who is 12

`<br>`{=html}

-   Examples of the ratio level of measurement in psychology

    -   Population of an area

    -   Distance between given points

    -   Score on an exam

    -   Income
:::

## Levels of measurement

-   **Measurement level is NOT an inherent characteristic of the
    measured attribute; it is the characteristic of the *measurement***

 

::: incremental
-   It is possible to measure a single thing at different levels

    -   Age can be on the **interval** level: years, months, weeks,
        days...

    -   In the avocado toast example, age was measured as membership in
        one a generation

    -   This can be seen as either a categorical or ordinal measurement
:::

## Variables

::: incremental
-   The point of measuring characteristics or attributes is to assess
    the value (*e.g.*, amount, number) of the given characteristic for
    each subject of interest (participant, city...)

    -   This is a trivial statement: if we knew someone's height, we
        wouldn't need to measure it

-   Why do we not know the value of the attribute for every subject?

    -   Because the value changes from case to case; it **varies**!

-   **A variable is a characteristic whose value varies within a set of
    subjects of interest**
:::

## Variables

::: incremental
-   Pretty much anything can be a variable

    -   Amount of greenery/traffic

    -   Accessibility/centrality of a location

    -   Type of land use

    -   People's attitude towards cycling

    -   Time point of measurement in a longitudinal study
:::

## Variables

::: incremental
-   Whether or not something is a variable is *independent of whether or
    not it is being measured!*

-   Even things that are not measured can be variables

    -   These are *unobserved* or *external* variables

    -   They need to be carefully considered when designing a study and
        interpreting findings
:::

## Variable roles

::: incremental
-   In a study a variable can be a **predictor variables** or an
    **outcome variables**

-   Predictor variables are variables used to model or *predict* outcome
    variables

    -   Cannabis use was the predictor variable in the gateway drug
        example
    -   Use of other illegal recreational drugs was the outcome
    -   In the avocado toast example, the generation to which a
        participant belonged was the predictor
    -   Liking of avocado toast was the outcome
:::

## Variable roles

::: incremental
-   In *experimental* design predictors are manipulated and the outcome
    is assumed to change as a result
-   Predictor is *independent* of the outcome: It's an **independent
    variable (IV)**
-   Outcome is *dependent* on the predictor: It's a **dependent variable
    (DV)**
-   The terms IV and DV are only used in experimental context
:::

## Variable roles

::: incremental
-   *Predictor* and *outcome* are roles we assign to variables based on
    theory

-   A variable that is the predictor in one theoretical model can be the
    outcome in another

-   If a theoretical framework is missing, it may not even be clear
    which variable fulfils which "role"

    -   In the example of swimming pool drownings and Nicolas Case
        films, it's not clear which is which
:::

## Variables of everyday

::: incremental
-   We often talk about variables in the context of maths, stats, and
    research
-   However, thinking about varying characteristics is just a way of
    systematising the world around us
-   We can apply it to most things, even books on your shelf:

```{=html}

## Variables

::: incremental
-   Some variables *vary* a lot (they contain many different *values*)
    -   Author's surname or year of publication
-   Others only change over a small number of values
    -   Rating or whether or not I read the book in its original
        language
-   Variables can **always be represented as number**
    -   *Superb* rating can be assigned the value 9, while a *Terrible*
        rating the value 1
    -   The more I like the book, the higher the number it gets
    -   Even **categorical** variables can be assigned *arbitrary*
        numeric values
:::

## Missing data

::: incremental
-   Sometimes not all information can be recorded; There can be
    **missing data**

-   In the [table](#53), there is no entry for "Rating" for for Jerzy
    Kosiński's novel *The Painted Bird*

    -   I haven't read it! ('cause it's in Polish)

-   Missing data are often assigned the value *NA*, for "**N**ot
    **A**pplicable"

-   The presence of missing data and the patterns in them can sometimes
    provide valuable information so it's important to be aware of them
    and explore them
:::

## Missing data

::: incremental
-   Missing values are not uncommon and can result from different causes
    -   An answer doesn't get registered
    -   Participants skip a question or a task by accident
    -   Recording error
    -   Participants don't wish to disclose a piece of information
    -   The information is not available
    -   The variable itself does not apply to the particular context
:::

## Variable types

::: incremental
-   Variables come in different types based on the **values they can
    contain**.

-   **Continuous variables** can contain **any numerical value** within
    a certain range

    -   *E.g.*, time allows for arbitrary precision: month, day, hour,
        minute, second...

-   **Discrete variables** can only contain **some values**

    -   *E.g.*, number of pages: always an *integer* (whole number)
    -   There's no such thing as a book with 52.74 pages

-   **Binary variables** can only take one of two possible values

    -   A special case of discrete variables
    -   The "Read in original" column can only contain the values "Yes"
        and "No"; there is no other option
    -   Heads vs tails, pass/fail...

## Variable types vs levels of measurement

::: incremental
-   Variables are *independent of whether or not we observe/measure
    them* and so the **type of variable is inherent to the
    characteristic** and not to the measurement

-   Observing of a variable involves measurement

-   Variables have to be measured on one of the **levels of
    measurement**

## Variable types vs levels of measurement

::: incremental
-   Book title variable has been measured on the *nominal (or
    categorical)* level

-   Publication year is measured on the *interval* level

    -   Hypothetically, we *could* measure when a book came out by
        measuring time since the big bang, in which case it would be
        measured on the *ratio* level
    -   *The underlying variable* is continuous

-   Like or dislike of a book is probably also continuous but was
    measured on a 9-point *ordinal* scale

-   As a shorthand it's common to say, for example, *"ordinal
    variable"*, when one means "variable measured on the ordinal level
    of measurement"
